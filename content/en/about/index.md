# {{ $doc.title }}

My name is Aleksandar Pejković and I currently work as an accountant in a primary school, but my goal is to develop as a **web developer**. I obtained the title of graduate economist. Additionally, I completed the **IT Academy** and several programming courses.

Through work and internships at companies such as **Endava** and **Epam**, I gained valuable experience that allowed me to expand my knowledge of technologies such as **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Nuxt.js**. I aim to become an expert in backend development, although I am also working on improving my frontend skills with technologies like **Vue.js** and **Nuxt.js**.

## My Interests

In addition to programming, I actively work on my health and fitness. I have a long-standing love for football, and currently, I focus on running and exercising to regain my fitness and achieve better physical health.

I'm a nature lover and often enjoy cycling and hiking on the local mountain Juhor.

## Projects

One of my most important projects is the **BudgetPlus** application, which I am developing to simplify daily accounting tasks for my colleagues at school. I am also working on an invoicing application called **ReliaBill** and exploring ways to expand its use for small businesses and agencies.

## What's Next?

In the future, I plan to further improve my skills in backend development while also becoming proficient in frontend technologies to become a complete web developer. My plans include further advancing in the **Spring Boot** ecosystem and working on developing complex web applications.

If you would like to know more about me or my projects, feel free to contact me via **[aleksandarpejkovic@hotmail.com](mailto:aleksandarpejkovic@hotmail.com)**.
